    cat:" Scenario Based",
   q:`Your 40-45% optimizaton story / Biggest technical achievement so far`,
answer:`<li> One of the significant challenges I faced was around pipeline performance in the Gold layer. Gold layer is where all the heavy lifting happens — SCD Type 2 MERGEs on dimension tables, upserts on fact tables, and aggregations for summary tables on top of that.
<li>Initially, the Gold layer jobs were running for 50-55 mins and sometimes taking much longer than expected. I opened the Spark UI and started analyzing the execution plans. A few things stood out.</li>
<li><ul>
<li>First, the MERGE operations on dimension and fact tables were doing full table scans — because without Z-ORDER, Delta had no way to skip irrelevant files when looking for matching keys. I applied Z-ORDER on the columns used in MERGE join conditions and common filter predicates, It clusters matching rows together physically, so MERGE reads far fewer files. Once that was in place, Delta's data skipping kicked in and the engine started skipping large portions of the table — MERGEs became significantly faster. </li>
<li>Second, since we run MERGE every day, each run was writing new small Delta files into the Gold tables. Over time this meant aggregation queries were opening hundreds of small files instead of a few large ones. I ran OPTIMIZE periodically to compact those files, which reduced the file count Spark had to open during aggregation scans considerably. </li>
<li>Third — and this is the one I found most impactful in the aggregation queries — we had multiple joins happening between the fact table and several dimension tables. Spark was doing SortMerge joins across all of them, which meant heavy shuffle stages. I went through each joining table and checked their sizes in the Spark UI. One of the reference dimension tables was around 20 MB — just above Spark's default auto-broadcast threshold of 10 MB, so it wasn't getting broadcasted automatically. I explicitly applied a broadcast hint on that table. That eliminated the shuffle stage for that join entirely — the small table was sent to every executor once and the join happened locally. The difference was immediately visible in the execution plan. </li></ul>
<li>The combination of these three — Z-ORDER for data skipping on MERGEs, OPTIMIZE for file compaction on aggregations, and broadcast hint for the small dimension table joins — brought down the overall Gold layer runtime by 40–45% </li>
</li>

   q:`Challenges faced and overcome`,
answer:`<li> One challenge we faced was schema changes from the Upstream PostgreSQL source, like new columns being added without notice, which used to break our Bronze-to-Silver pipelines.. Since Bronze was stored in Parquet, these columns were ingested without failure but led to schema drift. In Silver, we explicitly select required columns instead of using select *, so pipelines remain stable. We also detect new columns by comparing schemas during ingestion and trigger alert notifications, allowing us to review and onboard them in a controlled manner.</li>
<li>While reading Excel files from Unity Catalog Volumes, Spark initially threw a File Not Found error. After validating the path and volume access permissions, I realized the issue was actually due to Spark not having a native Excel reader.<br>

By default, Spark supports formats like Parquet, CSV, and JSON, but not Excel. So even though the file existed, Spark couldn't interpret it correctly. <br>

To resolve this, I added the external library com.crealytics:spark-excel_2.12:0.13.5 to the cluster. After that, I was able to successfully read the file using the custom format.</li>`,
